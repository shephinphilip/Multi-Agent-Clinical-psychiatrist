action_family_guidelines = """ 
What to Do

1. Before discussing family topics, explicitly define what information will remain confidential and what may need to be disclosed for safety (e.g., suicidal intent, abuse, or harm to others). Clarify this both to the adolescent and their parents to prevent misunderstanding.

2. Conduct part of the session privately with the adolescent or young adult to allow free disclosure about family conflicts, emotional distance, or fear of parents. Confidential one-to-one dialogue often yields more accurate emotional information than parent-present sessions.

3. Identify relational supports (caring parent, cooperative sibling, trusted caretaker) alongside stressors. This balanced approach improves treatment engagement and lowers defensiveness in family sessions.

4. Explore parental supervision, approval of risky behaviors, exposure to trauma, and family history of psychiatric or substance use disorders. Research shows these heavily influence adolescent emotional regulation and vulnerability to maladaptive coping


5. Evaluate the family in their primary language. Use interpreters when necessary to prevent misdiagnosis or miscommunication during family assessment

6. Maintain equal empathy for all family members. When conflicts arise (e.g., “my father is too strict”), explore both emotional impact and contextual motivation rather than validating one perspective exclusively.

7. Techniques such as multidimensional family therapy (MDFT) or functional family therapy (FFT) are empirically supported for reducing conflict, improving communication, and addressing attachment disruptions in adolescents

8. Adolescents often experience conflict as part of identity formation. Normalize moderate disagreement as developmental while differentiating it from abuse, neglect, or emotional control.

9. Observe how parental substance use, marital discord, or economic strain affects the adolescent’s symptoms. Incorporate psychoeducation and family stress-management work where appropriate.

What Not to Do

1. Avoid revealing the adolescent’s private disclosures to parents unless required for safety. Breaching trust undermines therapeutic alliance and reduces honesty in future sessions

2. Distinguish normative generational conflict (e.g., arguments about independence or discipline) from maladaptive emotional abuse or neglect.

3. Avoid treating the adolescent as the sole problem source. Reframe difficulties as systemic interactions among family members rather than inherent pathology in one individual.

4. Family hierarchy, parental authority, and caregiving styles vary across cultures. Interpret family discipline or collectivism through cultural context before labeling it as rigid or enmeshed.

5. Criticizing parents in front of the adolescent erodes alliance. Instead, redirect toward collaborative problem-solving and highlight intentions to protect or support.

6. If fear, physical harm, or coercive control is disclosed, move from family therapy to protective intervention and individual treatment planning. Mandatory reporting laws supersede confidentiality in such cases.

7. When one parent or sibling “allies” with the psychiatrist against another, reassert neutrality. Keep communication triangular (psychiatrist ↔ family unit) rather than dyadic alliances.

8. Promote autonomy with connection — helping adolescents express needs while maintaining safe relational bonds.

9. Aim for clarity, containment, and collaboration — the triad that stabilizes family discussions around sensitive topics like attachment, discipline, and loyalty conflicts.

10. Always document family strengths, conflict triggers, and safety concerns in each session summary.
"""

action_school_guidelines = """
School is the most revealing social and cognitive environment for a child. It mirrors self-esteem, motivation, peer adjustment, and executive functioning. When psychiatrists explore school topics, the goal is not academic correction but emotional mapping — to understand how learning and social experience reflect the child’s mental state.

1. Ask about school life before probing for problems. Example: “Tell me what a normal school day feels like for you.” This establishes a baseline and lowers defensiveness.

2. Evaluate Core Domains Systematically:

Academic performance: Track changes in grades, effort, or concentration. Decline without external explanation often signals mood, anxiety, or attention disorders.

Learning and cognition: Note patterns like incomplete tasks, forgetfulness, or avoidance. Distinguish between learning disability and attentional disturbance.

Teacher relationships: Assess perception of teachers—respect, fear, rejection, or perceived unfairness.

Peer relations: Identify isolation, conflict, or social withdrawal. Ask specifically about bullying, rejection, or being ignored.

Motivation and enjoyment: Inquire about favorite subjects or activities to detect anhedonia (loss of pleasure).

Attendance patterns: School refusal, tardiness, or psychosomatic complaints (headache, stomachache before class) often hide separation anxiety or social phobia.

3. Maintain a Developmental Lens
Interpret findings against expected developmental stage. Poor focus in a 7-year-old differs from academic burnout in a 15-year-old. Tailor hypotheses to cognitive maturity and social context.

4. Use Collaborative Triangulation
Gather data from teacher reports, parents, and the child, keeping accounts separate to identify discrepancies. Teachers often notice early cognitive or behavioral shifts unseen at home.

5. Screen for Psychiatric Correlates

Concentration & homework difficulty → ADHD, depression, anxiety.

Exam fear & school avoidance → performance anxiety, separation anxiety, or social phobia.

Bullying involvement → depression, trauma reaction, low self-worth, oppositional behavior.

Falling grades after stressor → grief, adjustment disorder, or family instability.

6. Explore Environmental and Systemic Contributors
Evaluate class size, curriculum pressure, teacher approach, and online learning demands. Environmental overload can mimic psychiatric symptoms.

7. Normalize and Contain Shame
Children equate academic failure with personal inadequacy. Use language separating behavior from identity (“You seem to be struggling with focus” instead of “You’re careless”).

8. Assess Coping and Support Systems
Ask who the child turns to for help — teacher, parent, friend. Lack of academic support amplifies hopelessness and anxiety.

9. Handle Bullying Directly and Clinically
When bullying is disclosed, validate distress first, then assess chronicity, location, and actors involved. Coordinate with parents and school counselors for safety, not punishment.

10. Document Educational Accommodations and Referrals
When attention, learning, or anxiety interfere significantly, recommend psychoeducational evaluation or Individualized Education Plan (IEP) referral. Collaboration with school psychologists is essential for continuity of care.

What Not to Do

1. Do Not Pathologize Ordinary Academic Stress
Transient anxiety before exams or frustration with teachers is normal. Diagnose only when impairment or chronic distress persists.

2. Do Not Rely Solely on Parent Reports
Parents may misattribute school issues to laziness or poor discipline. Always cross-check with teacher or counselor input.

3. Do Not Ignore Emotional Subtext in “Performance” Talk
A child discussing marks may be revealing fear of failure, rejection, or perfectionism. Attend to affect more than content.

4. Do Not Give Study Advice as Therapy
Avoid turning sessions into academic coaching. Psychiatric work focuses on emotional mechanisms (motivation, concentration, confidence), not productivity strategies.

5. Do Not Minimize Bullying or Social Exclusion
Even subtle exclusion or online bullying can cause major psychological injury. Dismissal breeds mistrust.

6. Do Not Force School Attendance During Acute Distress
If anxiety or trauma is severe, gradual reintegration or temporary home-based learning may be indicated. Immediate confrontation can worsen avoidance.

7. Do Not Overlook Neurodevelopmental Disorders
Attention complaints may mask ADHD, dyslexia, or executive dysfunction. Avoid premature labeling as “lazy” or “unmotivated.”

8. Do Not Discuss School Problems in Front of Peers or Siblings
Protect confidentiality. Exposure increases shame and defensiveness.

IV. Clinical Attitude

Be curious, not corrective.

Listen for emotion behind performance.

Maintain triangular balance between school, family, and child perspectives.

Anchor each observation to function and well-being, not to institutional success.
"""

action_peer_guidelines= """
Peer relationships are the emotional mirror of a child’s social development. They reveal how the child perceives belonging, empathy, self-worth, and safety. Disturbances in this area often signal depression, anxiety, trauma, or social communication disorders. The psychiatrist’s task is to decode how the child connects, withdraws, or performs socially, not merely whether they have friends.

What to Do

1. Establish a Non-Threatening Entry Point
Start with neutral questions about shared activities or group interactions (“Who do you usually spend time with at school?”). This lowers defensiveness and helps assess attachment style and comfort in social narration.

2. Evaluate Breadth and Depth of Friendships
Ask about number of friends, but focus on quality: trust, emotional closeness, loyalty, and conflict resolution. Having many peers but no confidant suggests social quantity without emotional connection.

3. Assess Emotional Reciprocity and Empathy
Notice whether the child describes mutual care (“we help each other”) or one-sided relationships (“I always listen, they don’t”). Deficits may indicate depressive detachment, social anxiety, or autistic-spectrum difficulties.

4. Identify Peer Group Dynamics
Explore how the child positions themselves within a group — leader, follower, outsider, observer. Observe for narratives of dominance, fear, or exclusion.

5. Probe for Isolation and Withdrawal
Voluntary solitude can be healthy; forced isolation or rejection signals distress. Distinguish between preference for quiet and avoidance born from fear or humiliation.

6. Explore Peer Pressure and Conformity
Ask indirectly about influence (“What do friends usually do when someone disagrees?”). Note if the child struggles to assert boundaries or adopts risky behaviors to maintain acceptance.

7. Screen for Rejection Sensitivity and Social Pain
Rejection experiences can lead to internalized shame, social anxiety, or anger dysregulation. Evaluate emotional intensity following minor social disappointments.

8. Include Digital and Social Media Behavior
Discuss online interactions — followers, messaging, comparison habits, or cyberbullying. The psychiatrist must explore digital identity’s emotional impact: validation-seeking, exposure, or harassment.

9. Assess Trust Formation
Ask who the child confides in and whether they feel safe doing so. Difficulties forming trust may trace back to trauma, inconsistent caregiving, or chronic peer betrayal.

10. Investigate Conflict and Repair
Healthy friendships tolerate disagreement and reconciliation. Chronic grudges, fear of confrontation, or abrupt breakups reflect fragile emotional regulation.

11. Observe Affect During Discussion
Pay attention to tone, pauses, and defensiveness. Sudden flatness, tension, or idealization of a “perfect friend” can mark underlying insecurity, attachment disruption, or dependency traits.

12. Use Collateral Information Carefully
Teachers and parents can describe peer functioning (playground behavior, group inclusion, bullying), but private child interviews remain essential for emotional truth. Always preserve confidentiality to maintain trust.

III. What Not to Do

1. Do Not Equate Introversion with Pathology
Solitude or small friend circles can be normal. Diagnose only when isolation leads to suffering, impaired function, or distorted self-image.

2. Do Not Minimize Peer Rejection
Even seemingly minor exclusion (“they didn’t invite me”) can deeply wound self-esteem. Avoid rationalizing it as normal school conflict.

3. Do Not Encourage Forced Socialization
Pushing a socially anxious or traumatized child into peer groups prematurely may reinforce fear and humiliation. Gradual exposure with skill training is safer.

4. Do Not Pathologize All Online Interaction
Digital communication can be adaptive. Evaluate how it’s used — not merely its presence — before assuming dysfunction.

5. Do Not Assume Parent Reports Reflect Peer Reality
Parents often underestimate loneliness or misinterpret online relationships. Base conclusions on child narratives and observable affect.

6. Do Not Ignore Gender and Cultural Social Norms
Peer bonding patterns differ across gender and culture. Interpret relational expectations through that lens before labeling behaviors as abnormal.

7. Do Not Intervene Without Context
For instance, a friendship breakdown during puberty may represent normal individuation, not pathology.

IV. Clinical Orientation

Goal: Understand the emotional architecture of belonging — connection, safety, rejection, and resilience.

Tone: Empathic neutrality — avoid cheerleading or alarm. Let the child’s language set the emotional temperature.

Framework: Integrate findings into broader diagnostic formulation (mood, anxiety, trauma, or neurodevelopmental spectrum).

Follow-Up: Reassess peer narratives periodically; improvement in relational confidence often parallels mental health recovery.
"""

action_developmental_guidelines = """
Developmental history reveals the trajectory of a child’s brain–behavior relationship — how biology, environment, and temperament interact over time. In psychiatric evaluation, it identifies neurodevelopmental vulnerabilities (autism, ADHD, learning disorders), early relational disruptions (insecure attachment, trauma), and early regulatory difficulties (sleep, feeding, toileting) that shape emotional resilience and behavior.

The aim is to reconstruct the child’s early developmental rhythm — not to interrogate parents for errors, but to understand patterns of regulation, attachment, and adaptation.

What to Do

1. Set a Neutral and Collaborative Tone
Parents often feel blamed when discussing early milestones. Frame questions as information-gathering for individualized understanding (“I want to know how your child has grown and adapted over time, to see what supports help best”).

A. Speech and Language

Ask about early milestones: When did the child start babbling, first words, combining words, understanding instructions.

Assess comprehension vs. expression: Children may understand far more than they speak (expressive delay) or vice versa (receptive delay).

Listen for pragmatics: Tone, social reciprocity, narrative flow — clues to social communication deficits or autism.

Red flags: Late talking, monotone speech, echolalia (repetition), literal interpretation, or regression of language.

Interpretation: Language delays can arise from hearing deficits, environmental deprivation, or neurodevelopmental conditions. Always ask about hearing tests and family language patterns.

B. Toilet Training

Ask age and emotional context: Smooth vs. conflictual toilet training.

Identify patterns of control or resistance: Persistent enuresis (bedwetting) or encopresis (soiling) beyond age norms may indicate anxiety, trauma, family stress, or oppositional features.

Note timing with stressors: Regression after major changes (school start, sibling birth, conflict) signals stress reactivity.

Assess parental approach: Excessive punishment or shame during toilet learning can contribute to guilt, secrecy, or control issues later.

C. Temper Tantrums and Emotional Regulation

Characterize early temperament: Was the child easy, difficult, or slow-to-warm?

Ask frequency, intensity, and triggers of tantrums — short frustration vs. explosive, destructive outbursts.

Differentiate normal developmental tantrums (ages 2–4) from pathologic patterns (after age 6, violent, prolonged, injurious, or manipulative).

Interpretation: Persistent dysregulation suggests ADHD, mood, anxiety, or trauma-related disorders.

Observe parental responses: Consistent containment predicts better outcomes; harsh or inconsistent discipline maintains volatility.

D. Sleep Patterns

Explore sleep onset, duration, and continuity.

Assess bedtime anxiety, nightmares, night terrors, co-sleeping, and early waking.

Correlate with emotional state: Depression → early morning awakening; anxiety → trouble falling asleep; trauma → recurrent nightmares.

Ask about devices or social media before bed.

Interpretation: Sleep disruption is often an early indicator of emotional dysregulation or environmental instability.

E. Feeding Habits

Ask about infancy feeding: breastfeeding duration, tolerance, texture sensitivity, appetite changes.

Identify food selectivity or sensory aversions: Can suggest autism, anxiety, or obsessive–compulsive traits.

Explore family mealtime atmosphere: chaos, coercion, neglect, or emotional tension around food.

Check for overeating or avoidance: May indicate self-soothing behaviors or control mechanisms in stress.

Correlate with growth data (weight and BMI trajectory).

F. Milestones (Gross, Fine Motor, and Social)

Ask timing: walking, running, dressing self, drawing, sharing, imitation, symbolic play.

Identify regression: Loss of skills after prior attainment often signals neurodevelopmental or neurological disorder.

Observe motor clumsiness or poor coordination — early markers of developmental coordination disorder or ADHD.

Include social milestones: eye contact, joint attention, pretend play — essential for autism spectrum evaluation.

III. Integration and Interpretation

Link delays or regressions to later-emerging emotional or behavioral symptoms.

Map patterns across domains — a single delay may be benign; a global or uneven profile often indicates broader neurodevelopmental conditions.

Recognize family adaptation — how caregivers responded to early challenges reveals resilience or chronic stress in the caregiving environment.

Consider biopsychosocial continuity: early regulatory issues (sleep/feeding/toileting) often evolve into later anxiety or control patterns.

IV. What Not to Do

1. Do Not Imply Blame or Parental Failure
Framing delays as parental fault destroys trust. Treat the developmental narrative as shared observation, not judgment.

2. Do Not Treat Milestone Charts as Diagnostic Absolutes
Use them as guides, not verdicts. Context (prematurity, bilingual environment, cultural expectations) must adjust interpretation.

3. Do Not Ignore Regression
Even brief loss of skills is clinically significant. Always explore timing, context, and potential neurologic or emotional stressors.

4. Do Not Overlook Sleep and Feeding as “Routine”
These are core regulators of mood and impulse control. Chronic disturbance is diagnostic, not trivial.

5. Do Not Ask Rapid-Fire Chronological Questions
Parents recall better when narrating in story form (“What was your child like as a baby?”) rather than being quizzed.

6. Do Not Exclude the Child’s Perspective
Older children can recall early habits (“I never liked sleeping alone”). Self-report enriches parental narrative.

7. Do Not End Without Summary Reflection
Summarize themes — e.g., “I see early signs of sensitivity and regulation difficulty that might connect to current anxiety.”
It shows active listening and builds alliance.

V. Clinical Orientation

Approach developmental history as a living timeline of regulation, connection, and adaptation.

Prioritize patterns over dates, emotional context over milestones, and relational meaning over statistics.

The psychiatrist’s lens: How did this child learn to be soothed, to control impulses, and to trust care?
"""

action_medical_guidelines = """
Medical and physical symptoms often serve as psychological languages in children — expressions of distress when verbal articulation fails. Somatic complaints, fatigue, or appetite changes can be the body’s translation of anxiety, depression, trauma, or environmental stress.
The psychiatrist’s objective is to decode these bodily signals without prematurely medicalizing or psychologizing — to understand whether the body is speaking for the mind, or whether genuine physical pathology is compounding emotional strain.

What to Do

1. Start With Medical Respect, Not Psychiatric Assumption
Ask open, factual questions about symptoms before exploring emotional connections.
Example: “When did the headaches start? What makes them better or worse?”
This builds credibility and avoids implying the pain is “imaginary.”

2. Clarify Onset, Duration, and Triggers
Establish timelines — sudden vs. chronic, situational vs. persistent.
Look for correlations with stressors (school tests, family conflict, bullying, sleep loss).

3. Review Medical Workups and Interventions
Ask about physician visits, lab tests, and medications. Unnecessary repetition or avoidance of medical care may indicate health anxiety, neglect, or secondary gain.

4. Assess Sleep and Energy Regulation
Persistent fatigue, early waking, or insomnia can indicate depression, anxiety, trauma hyperarousal, or medical conditions like anemia or thyroid dysfunction.
Ask about bedtime habits, device use, and nightmares.

5. Explore Appetite and Weight Changes
Loss of appetite, sudden restriction, or overeating may reflect mood changes, stress, or emerging eating disorders. Always correlate with growth charts and physical health data.
Ask neutrally: “Has your eating changed recently?” instead of “Are you eating enough?”

6. Examine Pain and Somatic Focus
Recurrent headaches, stomachaches, or limb pain often coincide with emotional suppression or family conflict.
Ask:

“Where do you usually feel it in your body?”

“When you’re upset, does your body feel different?”
This encourages emotional–somatic linkage without judgment.

7. Evaluate Illness Behavior
Look at how the child and family respond to illness — excessive attention, fear, or indifference. Recurrent absences from school may point to anxiety-based avoidance.

8. Assess Body Image and Self-Perception
Ask gently about satisfaction with appearance, comparisons with peers, and exposure to online content.
Be alert for distorted self-image, early dieting, or compulsive exercise — potential precursors of eating or body dysmorphic disorders.

9. Integrate Psychological and Physical Axes
When patterns of unexplained pain, fatigue, or appetite change coexist with mood or relational stress, conceptualize them as psychophysiological expressions.
Link symptoms with emotional context rather than dismissing them as “stress.”

10. Collaborate With Pediatricians
Maintain communication with medical professionals to avoid fragmented care. Psychiatrists must rule out anemia, endocrine disorders, infection, or medication side effects before attributing symptoms to psychological causes.

III. What Not to Do

1. Do Not Dismiss Physical Complaints as “Just Psychological.”
Somatic symptoms may have real physiological or mixed origins. Premature dismissal destroys trust and can cause missed diagnoses.

2. Do Not Overmedicalize Emotional Pain.
Avoid reflexively ordering tests or referrals when emotional patterns are clear. Over-investigation can reinforce health anxiety.

3. Do Not Minimize Fatigue or Sleep Problems.
Children rarely exaggerate exhaustion; it’s a sensitive indicator of mental depletion or poor circadian hygiene.

4. Do Not Overlook Eating and Body Image in Boys.
Distorted body perception (muscularity obsession, restrictive dieting) is increasingly common in males; it should be explored equally.

5. Do Not Ignore Cultural Factors.
Body ideals, diet rituals, and expressions of pain differ across cultures. Interpret body image or symptom reporting within family and cultural norms.

6. Do Not Confront Body Image Directly With Logic.
Telling a distressed adolescent “you look fine” invalidates their emotional reality. Instead, explore underlying fear and self-worth themes.

7. Do Not Separate Physical and Emotional Domains Artificially.
Children perceive the body and mind as one system. Always contextualize physical sensations within emotional life.

IV. Clinical Orientation

Principle: The body is a messenger; its symptoms are data, not defiance.

Goal: Integrate physical and emotional narratives into a single biopsychosocial understanding.

Tone: Grounded, curious, non-dismissive — blending clinical medical respect with psychological insight.

Outcome: A holistic picture where fatigue, appetite, pain, and body image are understood as windows into self-regulation, resilience, and stress adaptation.
"""

action_emotional_guidelines = """
Exploring emotional functioning reveals how a child perceives, regulates, and expresses internal states. It is the psychiatrist’s window into affective tone, resilience, and underlying psychiatric risk — depression, anxiety, trauma, or emotional dysregulation. The goal is not to label feelings but to map emotional literacy, recognize patterns, and differentiate transient mood from enduring disturbance.

What to Do

1. Create an Emotionally Safe Setting
Children reveal affect indirectly. Establish comfort and neutrality before discussing distress. Use tone, pacing, and language appropriate to age.
Example: “Sometimes people feel happy or sad in different ways. What’s it like for you most days?”

A. Mood and Affect

Assess baseline mood stability: Ask parents and the child how the mood changes across days or situations.

Observe congruence: Do facial expressions and tone match reported feelings?

Differentiate lability from volatility: Rapid mood shifts may stem from trauma, ADHD, or early bipolar patterns; chronic irritability often signals depression or anxiety in children, not defiance.

B. Sadness, Crying, and Hopelessness

Ask concretely: “When you feel sad, what usually happens?”

Note triggers: Is sadness situational or pervasive?

Evaluate for anhedonia (loss of interest): Diminished joy in play, withdrawal from friends, or flat tone.

Identify hopelessness: “Do you ever feel like things won’t get better?” Persistent hopelessness is a major predictor of self-harm risk.

Record crying patterns: Excessive crying or emotional numbness both indicate dysregulation.

C. Worry and Fear

Determine focus and control: Are worries specific (exams, separation) or generalized (everything feels dangerous)?

Ask about physical symptoms: Palpitations, stomachaches, sleep disturbance — typical in anxiety.

Identify avoidance behaviors: School refusal, excessive reassurance seeking, or perfectionism.

Explore trauma context: Fear without clear cause may reflect re-experiencing or hypervigilance.

D. Anger and Irritability

Clarify expression vs. suppression: Does the child act out, shut down, or internalize anger?

Ask about perceived injustice: Persistent anger toward authority may mask shame or anxiety.

Assess regulation: Duration, recovery time, and consequences of outbursts.

Differentiate chronic irritability (seen in depression, anxiety, or trauma) from episodic rage (seen in bipolar or impulse disorders).

Observe parental reactions: Excessive control or indulgence both perpetuate dysregulation.

E. Self-Esteem and Self-Concept

Ask identity-based questions: “What do you like about yourself?” “What do you wish were different?”

Listen for self-criticism, guilt, or shame.

Correlate self-esteem with performance: Does it fluctuate with grades, friendships, or parental approval?

Identify internalized labels: Children often absorb words (“lazy,” “stupid”) into self-definition.

Watch for perfectionism or self-devaluation: Both arise from conditional love or chronic comparison.

F. Emotional Vocabulary and Insight

Evaluate emotional literacy: Can the child name feelings or only describe actions (“I hit,” “I screamed”)?

For young children: Use stories, drawings, or play to elicit affect.

For adolescents: Reflect their language authentically; overclinical phrasing distances them.

Gauge empathy: Awareness of others’ feelings reveals social-emotional integration.

III. What Not to Do

1. Do Not Pathologize Normal Emotions
Sadness after loss or anger after unfairness is human, not disordered. Disturbance lies in intensity, duration, and functional impairment.

2. Do Not Ask Abstractly (“How do you feel generally?”)
Children struggle with global emotional questions. Anchor questions in context (“What goes through your mind when you get scolded?”).

3. Do Not Rush to Medication Discussion
Affective symptoms must be contextualized first — neurodevelopmental, relational, or situational. Premature pharmacologic focus undermines alliance.

4. Do Not Mirror Parental Minimization
Parents often normalize irritability or worry. Explore it independently. Children may disclose affect only when parent leaves the room.

5. Do Not Invalidate Emotional Narratives With Logic
Statements like “You shouldn’t worry about that” or “There’s no reason to be sad” break therapeutic safety.

6. Do Not Ignore Nonverbal Cues
Fidgeting, monotone speech, gaze avoidance, or tears are often more truthful than verbal reports.

7. Do Not Reinforce Shame
When discussing self-esteem or anger, avoid moralizing (“You must control yourself”). Focus on recognition and mastery, not judgment.

IV. Clinical Orientation

Core stance: The psychiatrist listens for pattern, persistence, and proportion — not isolated emotion.

Method: Link emotional expression to regulation systems (sleep, energy, appetite, relationships).

Objective: Understand how the child feels, expresses, and recovers — the triad that defines emotional health.

Documentation: Note emotional range, triggers, modulation, recovery, and self-image. This defines both diagnosis and therapeutic target.
"""


action_environmental_guidelines = """
Environmental stressors shape a child’s psychological terrain as profoundly as genetics. Chronic instability — whether economic, social, or physical — leaves measurable effects on emotional regulation, attachment security, and neurodevelopment.
The psychiatrist’s task is to identify the ecosystem around the child, not merely the child’s symptoms. These factors often explain anxiety, aggression, regression, or withdrawal better than any diagnostic label.

What to Do

1. Begin With Ecological Curiosity, Not Intrusion
Ask about the world the child lives in — safety, comfort, and continuity. Frame questions as concern for stability, not investigation:

“What’s it like where you live?”
“Are there times you feel unsafe at home or nearby?”

Neutral phrasing lowers defensiveness and avoids implying blame.

A. Neighbourhood and Community Context

Assess physical safety, exposure to neighborhood violence, substance use, or crime.

Explore availability of support systems — relatives, friends, teachers, mentors.

Ask about social cohesion (“Do people know and help each other where you live?”).

Note effects of unsafe environments: hypervigilance, sleep disturbance, restricted play, or mistrust.

B. Violence and Trauma

Clarify type, frequency, and witness vs. victim roles.

Include domestic violence, community aggression, or bullying.

Ask without sensationalism: “Have you seen or heard people hurting each other at home or outside?”

Observe affect — flatness, avoidance, or exaggerated calm can indicate traumatic dissociation.

Explore physiological hyperarousal: startle response, nightmares, vigilance, or irritability.

Document trauma timeline relative to symptom onset.

C. Financial and Housing Instability

Ask discreetly: “Have there been times when it was hard to pay for things or move often?”

Assess housing insecurity: crowding, eviction, temporary shelters, or displacement.

Link instability to behavioral symptoms — restlessness, attention problems, hoarding, guilt about parental stress.

Evaluate parent stress load: economic strain often drives intergenerational tension and emotional unavailability.

D. Migration and Cultural Adjustment

Explore migration history: voluntary vs. forced (refugee, displacement, disaster).

Assess adaptation stress — new language, school integration, cultural isolation.

Ask about identity tension (“Do you feel more like where you came from or where you are now?”).

Identify acculturation gaps between parents and children that can create hidden conflict.

Be aware of unprocessed grief from separation or cultural loss.

E. Loss and Bereavement

Document any significant deaths, separations, or losses (including pets, caregivers, or migration-related partings).

Assess meaning-making: “What do you think happens after someone dies?” reveals coping maturity.

Look for delayed or distorted grief — numbness, guilt, irritability, or regression.

Distinguish normal grief from depressive episodes by persistence and self-blame.

Provide psychoeducation on grief stages in developmentally appropriate terms.

III. Integrative Formulation

Map the Stress Network:
Identify how external instability (financial, housing, safety) translates into internal stress (hyperarousal, fatigue, mistrust).

Link to Coping Systems:
Examine child’s regulation methods — avoidance, caretaking behavior, fantasy, or aggression.

Assess Protective Factors:
Stable caregiver, supportive teacher, religious or community attachment often mitigate harm.

Formulate Trauma Continuum:
Distinguish acute trauma (single violent event) from chronic stress exposure (ongoing poverty, migration loss). Chronicity alters neuroregulation and must inform treatment planning.

IV. What Not to Do

1. Do Not Pathologize Poverty or Migration.
Socioeconomic adversity is a context, not a disorder. Diagnosis must be grounded in functional impairment, not circumstance.

2. Do Not Probe Violence Abruptly or Graphically.
Blunt questioning can retraumatize. Use calm tone, indirect inquiry, and allow pauses.

3. Do Not Ignore Caregiver Stress.
Parental burnout or hopelessness often mirrors the child’s anxiety. Family-level intervention may be required.

4. Do Not Offer Quick Reassurance.
Telling a child “It’s okay now” invalidates lived fear. Focus on building safety and trust first.

5. Do Not Isolate Trauma Discussion From Developmental Context.
Early trauma reshapes emotional, cognitive, and social milestones. Always integrate with developmental formulation.

6. Do Not Impose Cultural Assumptions.
Understand that expressions of grief, safety, and community vary across cultures and migration histories.

V. Clinical Orientation

Lens: Environmental conditions as active psychological forces — not background details.

Goal: Identify chronic stress exposure, assess emotional imprint, and strengthen coping systems.

Approach: Calm, trauma-informed, nonjudgmental, collaborative.

Focus: Restoration of safety, continuity, and meaning.
"""

action_cognitive_guidelines = """
Cognitive and behavioral assessment examines how a child perceives, processes, and responds to experiences. Difficulties in attention, thought content, or repetitive behavior often indicate neurodevelopmental, mood, or anxiety-related pathology.
The psychiatrist’s role is to determine whether these symptoms reflect neurocognitive deficits, emotional dysregulation, or obsessive–compulsive patterns, and to evaluate how they affect functioning in school, relationships, and daily life.

What to Do

1. Establish Cognitive Baseline
Ask about general attention span, task completion, memory for daily events, and ability to shift between tasks. Document consistency across settings (school, home).

2. Evaluate Attention and Concentration
Persistent distractibility may suggest ADHD, depression, anxiety, or substance-related effects.
Observe for in-session indicators: fidgeting, poor recall, off-topic responses, or excessive self-monitoring.

3. Assess Thinking Style and Speed
Note whether the child’s thought flow is coherent, tangential, or racing.
Slowed thought can indicate depression or fatigue; rapid or pressured thinking may suggest hypomanic or anxious states.

4. Explore Obsessive and Compulsive Features
Ask directly but calmly about repetitive thoughts (“Do thoughts ever come into your mind and won’t go away?”) and behaviors (“Do you ever feel you must do something again and again to feel safe or okay?”).
Distinguish between age-appropriate rituals and pathologic compulsions causing distress or interference.

5. Identify Intrusive Thoughts
Assess for intrusive or unwanted imagery, fears, or impulses — often ego-dystonic (experienced as alien or distressing).
Differentiate them from hallucinations or delusional content. Note associated anxiety or guilt.

6. Evaluate Memory Function
Ask about recent and remote recall: school instructions, personal events, or sequences.
Impairment can stem from depression, trauma, attention deficits, or medication/substance effects.

7. Use Behavioral Anchors
Correlate subjective complaints (“I can’t focus”) with observable evidence (school performance, errors, procrastination). Avoid overreliance on self-description alone.

8. Integrate Cognitive–Behavioral Patterns
Link thinking style to behavior:

Negative automatic thoughts → avoidance, low motivation.

Intrusive thoughts → compulsive checking or reassurance seeking.

Perfectionistic cognition → anxiety and delay.

9. Apply Cognitive–Behavioral Therapy (CBT) Principles in Assessment
When symptoms overlap with substance use or stress conditions, guidelines emphasize CBT-based approaches for early treatment, combining symptom monitoring and coping strategies before formal pharmacologic intervention

10. Rule Out Comorbid Conditions
Obsessive–compulsive disorder, ADHD, anxiety disorders, trauma-related disorders, and mood disorders frequently coexist; symptoms may mimic each other (e.g., distractibility in anxiety vs. ADHD)

What Not to Do

1. Do Not Treat Intrusive Thoughts as Psychotic Symptoms Without Context.
Differentiate ego-dystonic obsessions from hallucinations or delusions; children often fear their own thoughts but recognize them as irrational.

2. Do Not Assume Poor Focus Equals ADHD.
Depression, trauma, anxiety, or substance withdrawal can all impair attention. Use chronology and context to clarify onset.

3. Do Not Overinterpret Normal Ruminative Thinking.
Transient worry or self-talk can be age-appropriate; diagnose only if persistence causes distress or functional loss.

4. Do Not Reinforce Compulsions.
Avoid participating in reassurance rituals or safety behaviors during interviews.

5. Do Not Ignore Cognitive Symptoms During Withdrawal or Intoxication.
As per AACAP guidance, these may mimic psychiatric conditions; early management should favor CBT-based monitoring over immediate pharmacologic labeling


6. Do Not Separate Cognitive Findings From Emotional Context.
Cognitive symptoms rarely exist in isolation; always integrate mood, sleep, and environmental data.

IV. Clinical Orientation

Lens: Cognitive–behavioral functioning as both symptom and coping mechanism.

Approach: Structured, hypothesis-driven, yet empathic exploration of how thought patterns influence emotion and behavior.

Goal: Differentiate developmental variation from psychopathology, and identify maladaptive cognitive loops that perpetuate distress.

Outcome: A coherent map of the child’s thinking style, attention control, and behavioral responses — guiding both diagnostic formulation and therapeutic planning.

action_social_support_guidelines = """
Social support is both a protective buffer and a therapeutic amplifier in child and adolescent psychiatry. It mediates resilience against stress, moderates risk for depression and substance use, and promotes recovery from trauma.
The psychiatrist’s role is to assess availability, quality, and perceived reliability of support systems, while identifying social isolation, mistrust, or unsafe relationships that undermine healing.

What to Do

1. Assess the Child’s Support Map
Ask who the child turns to when upset or in trouble. Note emotional anchors (friends, teachers, counsellors) versus formal supports (therapists, school staff).

“When you feel sad or worried, who helps you feel better?”

This reveals trust patterns and emotional accessibility.

2. Evaluate Quality Over Quantity
A large social circle may not equate to meaningful connection. Focus on perceived safety, consistency, and empathy in each relationship.

3. Explore Trust and Safety
Ask about emotional safety within relationships. A lack of trust may indicate trauma, bullying, or chronic invalidation.

“Do you feel safe talking about your feelings with anyone?”

4. Identify Adult Figures of Guidance
Teacher, coach, or relative support often compensates for parental gaps. Acknowledge and reinforce these ties.
Assess if guidance is nurturing or controlling.

5. Include School and Community Contexts
Teachers, counsellors, and peers form the primary scaffolds of adolescent support. Explore interactions with authority figures and peer mentors — their presence predicts better coping with academic and social stress.

6. Investigate Counsellor and Therapeutic Links
Ask if the child has prior or ongoing counselling experience. Gauge openness to professional help and family attitudes toward therapy.

7. Evaluate Relational Reciprocity
Determine whether the child gives and receives support symmetrically. One-sided caregiving or chronic withdrawal suggests emotional burden or depressive traits.

8. Look for “Safe Spaces”
Identify physical or psychological spaces (room, friend group, online support group) where the child feels protected and authentic. Encourage the maintenance of such environments.

9. Screen for Social Burnout or Dependence
Excessive reliance on one person or constant help-seeking may mask dependency or anxiety. Balance between autonomy and connection is key.

10. Integrate Social Support Into Care Planning
Following AACAP and ASAM principles, align treatment within a person-centered, least-restrictive environment emphasizing family and community coordination. Reinforce multi-actor collaboration among caregivers, teachers, and counsellors for sustained therapeutic outcomes
What Not to Do

1. Do Not Assume Family Equals Support
Family members can be sources of conflict or invalidation. Always differentiate between biological proximity and emotional safety.

2. Do Not Overvalue Peer Support Without Structure
Peers may reinforce avoidance or risk behaviors. Supervise adolescent reliance on peer groups, especially in digital contexts.

3. Do Not Force Disclosure
Children may withhold information about unsafe relationships out of fear or loyalty. Build gradual trust; never demand details.

4. Do Not Undervalue Informal Helpers
Neighbours, religious leaders, or extended kin often provide stability — include them in the ecosystem when appropriate.

5. Do Not Isolate Treatment From Social Context
Therapy detached from the child’s real-world network loses continuity. Bridge school, family, and counselling domains collaboratively.

6. Do Not Treat Lack of Support as a Personality Flaw
It often reflects systemic neglect, trauma, or mobility — not relational incompetence.

IV. Clinical Orientation

Framework: Ecological — every child functions within layered systems (family, school, peers, community).

Approach: Collaborative and restorative — build scaffolds, not just insight.

Goal: Reinforce trust, ensure the presence of at least one emotionally safe adult, and mobilize supportive systems.

Documentation: Record presence, accessibility, and reliability of supports across settings.
